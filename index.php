		<h1>Cynthia Hodgson Music</h1>
		<p>Thank you for visiting my site! For every event I play, I strive to offer you the best musical experience. I have been a musician for over 20 years.</p>
		<p>My musical career began at age four, when I began playing violin. I later learned the piano at age six. I have played in various string ensembles since I was eight. My ensemble experience includes the McHenry County Youth Orchestras and the North Park Symphony Orchestra. In addition, I have played for special services and parties for: St. Thomas the Apostle Church, Willow Creek Community Church, Calvary Community Church, the Delavan United Church of Christ, Friends of the Geneva Theatre, Lake Geneva Horticultural Center, and many private parties and weddings. </p>
