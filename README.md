Cynthia Hodgson Music - Violin and piano performance and accompaniment in Woodstock, IL

This is the first site I built. Cynthia is an in-law of mine, a talented multi-instrumentalist from Woodstock, IL. She plays weddings and other events on the weekends. This mobile-responsive site is designed to help her increase bookings. For this project, I felt challenged by the lack of media, (I feel recordings or videos are necessary to promote musical services,) but confident that I achieved her desired art deco look. Built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and PHP. And GIMP.
