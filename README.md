Cynthia Hodgson Music - Violin performance and accompaniment in Woodstock, IL - Wedding violinist

## Milestone 1 & 2a Feedback
Excellent work on both Milestones here.

First things first - that darn .idea directory made it into your repo! Unfortunately you'll have to re-create your project. But be sure to archive all of your current work, and nothing should be lost! (Ask us if you need the TL; DR on this process.)

Other than that, everything else looks great technically!

It is evident you clearly understand the needs of both Cynthia and her target audience, and all aspects of your planning phase shown here are consistent and congruent with both Cynthia's stated goals and those of the targeted end user.

A one-page scrolling layout is an excellent choice here. The most effective one page layouts strike a balance between content and negative space. A one-page layout can easily becoming visually overwhelming if there is too much content present and not enough "breathing room" in the layout. 

Featuring a fixed top nav is a good choice given that this site will scroll down through 5 content sections. This is easily done using Bootstrap's fixed navbar.

The extra work you put into creating mockups will serve as a detailed guide for your front end development. On the mobile view, the only consideration to keep in mind is that horizontal space is limited on mobile. So, think about stacking those side-by-side content regions for narrow screens.

Parallax scrolling will add a nice touch. This is generally achieved with the help of a 3rd party JavaScript plugin, and a small amount of JavaScript customization. Two popular libraries for parallax effects are [Skrollr](http://prinzhorn.github.io/skrollr/) and [Stellar.js](http://markdalgleish.com/projects/stellar.js/), and have a look at the source code for following example I have up: [Bootstrap Parallax Demo](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/bootstrap/stellar-parallax.php). Be advised that parallax effects are notoriously buggy on mobile devices, so we suggest disabling it entirely on mobile views. 

Awesome job here. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) (due to late submission), and your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin development on your PWP.
