			<h2>Personal Website Project - Milestone 2</h2>

			<h3></Sitemap></h3>

				<p>For this site, I will use only one page with five sections. Navigational links and scrolling both take users from one section to the next. The five sections will be:</p>

				<ul>About</ul>
				<ul>Repertoire</ul>
				<ul>Rates and Details</ul>
				<ul>Testimonials</ul>
				<ul>Contact</ul>

				<p>I intend to learn how to code parallax scrolling for this site, so that the header and possibly background stay the same, while the middle content changes.</p>
