			<h2>Personal Website Project - Milestone 2</h2>
			
			<h3>Sitemap</h3>
			
				<p>For this site, I will use only one page with five sections. Navigational links and scrolling both take users from one section to the next. The five sections will be:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>About</li>
					<li>Repertoire</li>
					<li>Rates and Details</li>
					<li>Testimonials</li>
					<li>Contact</li>
				</ol>
				
			<p>I intend to learn how to code parallax scrolling for this site, so that the header and possibly background stay the same, while the middle content changes.</p>

			<h3>Content Strategy</h3>
			
				<p>The <strong>About</strong> section will contain Cynthia's welcome message and bio:</p>
					<ul>Thank you for visiting my site! For every event I play, I strive to offer you the best musical experience. I have been a musician for over 20 years. My musical career began at age four, when I began playing violin. I later learned the piano at age six. I have played in various string ensembles since I was eight. My ensemble experience includes the Lake Geneva Symphony Orchestra, the North Park Symphony Orchestra, and the McHenry County Youth Orchestra. In addition, I have played for special services and parties for: St. Thomas the Apostle Church, Willow Creek Community Church, Calvary Community Church, the Delavan United Church of Christ, Friends of the Geneva Theatre, Lake Geneva Horticultural Center, and many private parties and weddings.</ul>
					<ul>As a pianist, I have had the opportunity to play as a soloist and accompanist. My styles of piano playing include classical, jazz, pop/love songs, and ragtime. I am also available to accompany other musicians. Please note that at this time I do request that a piano or keyboard be provided for me. Currently, I am a violinist with the Lake Geneva Symphony. In addition, I am a member of my local churchâ€™s praise team, where I serve as violinist, pianist & vocalist for the weekly services. Many blessings to you! I look forward to creating musical memories for your special occasion.</ul>
					<ul>Should you be requesting an ensemble, the other musicians are also members of the Lake Geneva Symphony Orchestra or other area ensembles. My ensemble can cover violin, viola, cello, piano, and flute.</ul>
				<p>The <strong>Repertoire</strong> section will list the pieces Cynthia knows and often plays at special events, plus a message about special requests.</p>
				<p>The <strong>Rates and Details</strong> section will display a table of costs involved with hiring Cynthia, plus footnotes such as her policy on late payments.</p>
				<p>The <strong>Testimonials</strong> section lists quotes from brides who have hired her, conveying that she does a great job.</p>
				<p>The <strong>Content</strong> section will include a contact submission form and picture. Cynthia is concerned about a stalker-ish ex-boyfriend, so she would prefer not to list her own information. However, I will encourage her to set up a Google Voice number and an email account for her bookings, such as cynthiahodgsonmusic@gmail.com, that she would feel comfortable list. The Contact page will have four submission fields:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Name - required</li>
						<li>Phone</li>
						<li>Email</li>
						<li>Message - required</li>
					</ul>
				<p>I will create a popup diaglog box saying, "You have not entered a method of contact" if the user does not fill in either the phone or email fields. </p>

			<h3>Interaction Flow</h3>

				<p>Since this will be a single-page design, users have two options for flow. They could scroll down the page, loading each section in succession, which represents the complete, story-like way to view the site. Or, they could use the navigational links at the top to skip between sections, to instantly locate the information they need. For example, Rates and Details falls in the middle of the site, but for some users, such as that of my persona, cost will be the most important consideration. Such a user would use the navigational link at the top to evaluate Cynthia's costs first, then jump around. I hope that a simple, elegant layout will keep such a user from getting overwhelmed.</p>
