			<h2>Personal Website Project - Milestone 1</h2>

<p>This PWP will be for my friend Cynthia, a violinist. She is seeking a site to promote her professional services.</p>

			<h2>Audience</h2>

<p>My site is designed for people in the northwest Chicago suburbs and southern Wisconsin, (where Cynthia is from,) who need to hire a violinist. I expect a large focus to be on wedding accompaniment.</p>

			<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>To market Cynthia's services, showcase her playing, and anything else she wants to work in, such as recruit social media followers.</p>

			<h2>Persona</h2>

<p>Jane is a 28-year-old woman in Woodstock, IL who is planning her wedding. She's a little overwhelmed by how much there is to do, and has a checklist. Finding a performer for background music seemed to be one of her easier tasks, so she is beginning there. She found Cynthia's site, but doesn't know exactly what she wants performed.</p>
