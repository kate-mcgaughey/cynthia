			<h2>Personal Website Project - Milestone 1</h2>

<p>This PWP will be for my cousin's wife Cynthia, a violinist. She is seeking a site to promote her professional services.</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>

<p>This site is designed for people in the northwest Chicago suburbs and southern Wisconsin, (this is where Cynthia lives,) who need to hire a violinist or small ensemble. I expect a large focus to be on wedding accompaniment.</p>

			<h3>Goal</h3>

<p>The end goal is to increase Cynthia's bookings at events such as weddings.</p>

			<h3>Persona</h3>

<p>Jane is a 28-year-old woman in Woodstock, IL who is planning her wedding. She's a little overwhelmed by how much there is to do, and has a checklist. Finding a performer for background music seemed to be one of her easier tasks, so she is beginning there. She found Cynthia's site, but doesn't know exactly what she wants performed.</p>
