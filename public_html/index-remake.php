						<h1>Welcome!</h1>
						<p class="text-justify">Thank you for visiting my site! I am a violin and piano player from Woodstock
							with over 20 years experience in solo performance, ensembles, weddings, and private parties. For
							every event, I strive to offer you the best musical experience.</p>
						<p class="text-justify">I have had the opportunity to play as a soloist and accompanist. My styles of
							piano playing include classical, jazz, pop/love songs, and ragtime. I am also available to
							accompany other musicians. Please note that at this time I do request that a piano or keyboard be
							provided for me. Currently, I am a violinist with the Lake Geneva Symphony. In addition, I am a
							member of my local church’s praise team, where I serve as violinist, pianist, and vocalist for the
							weekly services. Many blessings to you! I look forward to creating musical memories for your
							special occasion.</p>
						<p class="text-justify">Should you be requesting an ensemble, the other musicians are also members of
							the Lake Geneva Symphony Orchestra or other area ensembles. My ensemble can cover violin, viola,
							cello, piano, and flute.</p>

						<h1>Testimonials from Past Clients</h1>
						<p>"Cynthia played our November 2013 wedding at Hawk's View Golf Club in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. We
							had a great experience!  My husband and I had met with Cynthia months prior to the ceremony where
							she listened to what we were looking for and created a music set to match the theme and feel of our
							wedding. She was a pleasure to work with and played beautiful music during our ceremony and
							cocktail hour. We were very happy with her and thought that the live music really added a great
							touch to our special day!"   ~ Angel</p>
						<p>"After hearing Cynthia play at my friend’s wedding, I knew I wanted her to play for my ceremony as
							well. Cynthia and another violinist played for my wedding in at the Holiday Inn Crystal Lake on
							August 2, 2014. Cynthia was amazing and it was such a special and personal touch for my wedding
							day!"   ~ Sara</p>
						<p>"The music Cynthia played for our wedding ceremony added an element that could not be duplicated by
							anyone else. The string music created a romantic and elegant setting outdoors by the water. Cynthia
							is very professional, she answered every e-mail promptly and was very assuring with sincerity as I
							had so many questions, and she made things stress-free! If you are looking for a string musician to
							add to your wedding I would recommend her. People say that your own wedding is a blur and you can
							barely remember what happens during throughout the day because it goes by so fast, but one of the
							things I do remember is the music being played as I was walking down the aisle with my father. It
							is most memorable! We also had a lot of our guests tell us that the music during the ceremony was
							the perfect touch and it couldn't have been better in any way."   ~ Oceana</p>
						<p>"The Abbey Resort listed Cynthia on their preferred vendor’s list as a classical musician, an she
							was absolutely a joy to work with in planning music. I was clueless when it came to wedding music,
							and she guided me through each step of the way with patience and professionalism. When it came to
							the day of the wedding the music was simply gorgeous and added so much to our special day." ~
							Rachel</p>
						<p>"When my original wedding plans changed due a family illness, we called countless area musicians
							before finding Cynthia. I didn't know if she would be willing to play for us on such short notice,
							but not only was she available, she also organized the entire musical layout for us in less than a
							day! Not only did she play for the ceremony, but she was also very helpful in calming a nervous
							bride's spirit. It ended up raining during the middle of our ceremony and I was so nervous Cynthia
							wouldn't be able to play her violin due to the conditions. She surprised everyone by SINGING the
							“Ave Maria” instead of playing it and had even asked our wedding planner for an umbrella so her
							instrument could stay dry enough to play our recessional. Cynthia is one of the most caring,
							compassionate and insanely talented people I’ve ever met." ~ Victoria</p>
						<p>"I decided to take the music planning into my own hands for our wedding. I had no clue what I was
							doing and only had mentioned to Cynthia that I really had liked a few contemporary pieces my wife
							and I listened to on the radio. Classical music wasn't really our style and we wanted music that
							was a little bit different. Not only did Cynthia work with our pianist in planning the playlist,
							she ended up playing an incredible classical version of our favorite song as well. Cynthia
							responded to all our questions and didn't laugh at how clueless we were when it came to classical
							music. Cynthia worked with us to select music to reflect our style and also still make it her own
							too.”  ~ Brian</p>
						<p>"Cynthia played our wedding at the Geneva Inn.  We had originally planned on hiring a DJ, but I'm
							so glad we chose live music instead. We had a small ceremony, but the music added so much to this.
							Originally we had hired Cynthia only for the ceremony, but at the very last minute we asked if she
							could stay for cocktail hour as well. Not only did Cynthia play an extra hour for us at the last
							minute, she also spoke to the restaurant pianist and played and sang for us so we could actually
							have a "first dance" (which we had not planned on doing.) It was amazing!” ~ Megan</p>
						<p>"Cynthia's presence and talent made our party (my parent’s anniversary celebration) come to life.
							She is open to suggestions and requests. I'm planning on using her for our wedding ceremony this
							year." ~ Michelle
						<p>"Because I had previously heard Cynthia perform and seen her amazing talents, she was the first one
							who came to mind to provide music at our wedding.  The violin pre-service music was simply
							beautiful.  I had written some customized lyrics for my husband to the song Evergreen that Cynthia
							sang during the service.  I will forever remember that special day in my life as all details,
							including the music, made it so magical!  ~ Pam</p>
