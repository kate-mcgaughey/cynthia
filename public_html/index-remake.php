									<h1>Welcome!</h1>
									<p class="text-justify">Thank you for visiting my site! I am a violin and piano player from Woodstock with over 20 years experience in solo performance, ensembles, weddings, and private parties. For every event, I strive to offer you the best musical experience.</p>
									<p class="text-justify">I have had the opportunity to play as a soloist and accompanist. My styles of piano playing include classical, jazz, pop/love songs, and ragtime. I am also available to accompany other musicians. Please note that at this time I do request that a piano or keyboard be provided for me. Currently, I am a violinist with the Lake Geneva Symphony. In addition, I am a member of my local church’s praise team, where I serve as violinist, pianist, and vocalist for the weekly services. Many blessings to you! I look forward to creating musical memories for your special occasion.</p>
									<p class="text-justify">Should you be requesting an ensemble, the other musicians are also members of the Lake Geneva Symphony Orchestra or other area ensembles. My ensemble can cover violin, viola, cello, piano, and flute.</p>

							<h1>Testimonials from Past Clients</h1>
							<p>"Cynthia played our November 2013 wedding at Hawk's View Golf Club in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. We had a great experience!  My husband and I had met with Cynthia months prior to the ceremony where she listened to what we were looking for and created a music set to match the theme and feel of our wedding. She was a pleasure to work with and played beautiful music during our ceremony and cocktail hour. We were very happy with her and thought that the live music really added a great touch to our special day!"   ~ Angel</p>
							<p>"After hearing Cynthia play at my friend’s wedding, I knew I wanted her to play for my ceremony as well. Cynthia and another violinist played for my wedding in at the Holiday Inn Crystal Lake on August 2, 2014. Cynthia was amazing and it was such a special and personal touch for my wedding day!"   ~ Sara</p>
							<p>"The music Cynthia played for our wedding ceremony added an element that could not be duplicated by anyone else. The string music created a romantic and elegant setting outdoors by the water. Cynthia is very professional, she answered every e-mail promptly and was very assuring with sincerity as I had so many questions, and she made things stress-free! If you are looking for a string musician to add to your wedding I would recommend her. People say that your own wedding is a blur and you can barely remember what happens during throughout the day because it goes by so fast, but one of the things I do remember is the music being played as I was walking down the aisle with my father. It is most memorable! We also had a lot of our guests tell us that the music during the ceremony was the perfect touch and it couldn't have been better in any way." ~ Oceana</p>
							<p>"The Abbey Resort listed Cynthia on their preferred vendor’s list as a classical musician, an she was absolutely a joy to work with in planning music. I was clueless when it came to wedding music, and she guided me through each step of the way with patience and professionalism. When it came to the day of the wedding the music was simply gorgeous and added so much to our special day." ~ Rachel</p>
							<p>"When my original wedding plans changed due a family illness, we called countless area musicians before finding Cynthia. I didn't know if she would be willing to play for us on such short notice, but not only was she available, she also organized the entire musical layout for us in less than a day! Not only did she play for the ceremony, but she was also very helpful in calming a nervous bride's spirit. It ended up raining during the middle of our ceremony and I was so nervous Cynthia wouldn't be able to play her violin due to the conditions. She surprised everyone by SINGING the “Ave Maria” instead of playing it and had even asked our wedding planner for an umbrella so her instrument could stay dry enough to play our recessional. Cynthia is one of the most caring, compassionate and insanely talented people I’ve ever met." ~ Victoria</p>
							<p>"I decided to take the music planning into my own hands for our wedding. I had no clue what I was doing and only had mentioned to Cynthia that I really had liked a few contemporary pieces my wife and I listened to on the radio. Classical music wasn't really our style and we wanted music that was a little bit different. Not only did Cynthia work with our pianist in planning the playlist, she ended up playing an incredible classical version of our favorite song as well. Cynthia responded to all our questions and didn't laugh at how clueless we were when it came to classical music. Cynthia worked with us to select music to reflect our style and also still make it her own too.”  ~ Brian</p>
							<p>"Cynthia played our wedding at the Geneva Inn.  We had originally planned on hiring a DJ, but I'm so glad we chose live music instead. We had a small ceremony, but the music added so much to this. Originally we had hired Cynthia only for the ceremony, but at the very last minute we asked if she could stay for cocktail hour as well. Not only did Cynthia play an extra hour for us at the last minute, she also spoke to the restaurant pianist and played and sang for us so we could actually have a "first dance" (which we had not planned on doing.) It was amazing!” ~ Megan</p>
							<p>"Cynthia's presence and talent made our party (my parent’s anniversary celebration) come to life. She is open to suggestions and requests. I'm planning on using her for our wedding ceremony this year." ~ Michelle
							<p>"Because I had previously heard Cynthia perform and seen her amazing talents, she was the first one who came to mind to provide music at our wedding.  The violin pre-service music was simply beautiful.  I had written some customized lyrics for my husband to the song Evergreen that Cynthia sang during the service.  I will forever remember that special day in my life as all details, including the music, made it so magical!  ~ Pam</p>
							<h1>Testimonials from Fellow Musicians and Worship Leaders</h1>
							<p>"Cynthia is great to work with. Her passion and gifting in music is evident. Her level of flexibility is admirable. Working with her on a consistent basis has been a pleasure and a delight because she brings such joy to our team. I look forward to leading worship with her on Sundays. Having a great musician isn't just in their ability to play, but in their ability to adjust to the people they are working with. She does this well."   ~ Robert Cager, Worship Minister, Woodstock Assembly of God
							<p>"Cynthia is a fantastic musician who has shared her gift of music with our congregation in worship many times.  She is delightful to work with and brings a wide range of talent.  We always look forward to having her enhance our worship with music. She is creative, flexible and thoughtful in her choice of selections to share.  I highly recommend her."  ~ Rev. Laura McLeod, Senior Pastor, Delavan United Church of Christ</p>
							<p>"Cynthia Hodgson is passionate about music and this can be felt in her beautiful performances. She has provided many joyful moments for our congregation when she shares her gift of music during worship service. Cynthia is marvelous to work with - she is flexible and upbeat. She is multi-talented musician who has a great understanding of music and is able to inspire all who hear her perform." ~ Nancy Rasmussen, Director of Music Ministry, Delavan United Church of Christ</p>
